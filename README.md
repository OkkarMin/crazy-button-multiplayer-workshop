# Crazy Buton workshop for SCSE Freshman 2021

Curated with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Okkar Min](https://okkarm.in), [Ying Sheng](https://yeowys.com) and [Jiayin](https://github.com/lhinjy)

## End product

![GIF of end product](/static/end_product.gif)

We are going to build a platform

- Has a button
- That button moves to a random location when another player press the button on their side
- Keep count of the the players score

## What you will learn

You will understand

- Client - Server architecture
- WebSocket concept
- How to build and manipulate a webpage using HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- How to build Python websocket server

# What is Client Server Architecture?

![Client Server Model image taken from StackOverflow](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qUyFW.png)

1. Client REQUEST from server (Client ‚û°Ô∏è Server)
2. Server RESPONSE to client (Server ‚û°Ô∏è Client)
3. Client make use of data from Server (Text, Image, Video etc...)
4. Repeat 1 through 3

**Server RESPONSE with data when Client REQUEST**

## Daily Example:

You visit YouTube

1. Your laptop (client) request to YouTube (server) asking for data
2. YouTube (server) respond to your laptop with data
3. Your laptop (client) shows you the home page of YouTube
4. You click on a video, repeat 1 through 3

# What is WebSocket?

![WebSocket Model image taken from StackOverflow](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ReJux.png)

1. Client REQUEST for handshake (Client ‚û°Ô∏è Server)
2. Sever RESPONSE with handshake confirmation (Server ‚û°Ô∏è Client)
3. Client - Server socket connection established (Client ‚ÜîÔ∏è Server)
4. Connect is established till Client or Server close the connection

**Server push data to Client, without Client asking for it**

## Daily Example:

You visit Facebook

1. Your laptop (client) request to Facebook (server) asking for handshake
2. Facebook (server) respond to your laptop with handshake confirmation
3. Your laptop (client) and Facebook (server) WebSocket connection established
4. You get a notification when somebody message you, new post etc...

# Our Crazy Button architecture

1. Your laptop make request to server for handshake
2. Server respond with handshake confirmation
3. Server push data to your client when:
   - a new player join
   - the button was clicked
   - a player has left
4. Your laptop process on data received from server

## Initial connection

## A new player connected

## The button was pressed

## A player disconnected

# Building our Crazy Button page

Button page requirements

1. A Button for players to click

   - Button should move randomly on every player screen when one player has clicked

2. Leaderboard that show list of connected players

   - current player should be at the top of the list
   - should show player score

# Building our WebSocket server

WebSocket server requirements

1. Should emit `player_connected` event when a new player connect to the server

   - should sent the following data to client
     - current connected `playerList`

2. Should emit `player_disconnected` event when a player disconnect from the server (player close tab|browser)

   - should sent the following data to client
     - current connected `playerList`

3. Should emit `new_button_locaton` event when a player has clicked the button

   - should keep track of which player clicked the button, so that we can show the score
   - should calculate random values for the button to move
   - should sent the following data to client

     - randomTop, randomLeft a number between 0 to 1 [0, 1]
     - current connected `playerList`

4. Current connected `playerList` should contain
   - playerID and
   - playerScore

    # announce to everybody connected that a new player has connected
